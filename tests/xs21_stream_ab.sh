# A/B: resident vs streamed output must agree for Laguna XS 2.1 (greedy decode).
#
# Task 6 wired XS 2.1's routed experts through the Metal streaming expert
# cache. Task 3 already showed this family fails *plausibly* -- its decode
# dispatch bug produced coherent-but-wrong tokens rather than a crash -- so
# "streaming generates something reasonable" proves nothing. This gate is what
# actually proves it: identical greedy output, resident vs streamed.
#
# The cache is deliberately undersized (800 experts, well under one layer's
# worth across several layers) to force heavy eviction. A correct
# implementation is bytewise-identical to resident anyway, because every cache
# miss falls back to the mapped-model path.
#
# Bytewise comparison follows the repo's existing convention for greedy
# regressions (CONTRIBUTING.md "Correctness Regression Tests" -- the
# --logprob-vectors test compares local token bytes directly).
#
# Usage: ./tests/xs21_stream_ab.sh [MODEL]
